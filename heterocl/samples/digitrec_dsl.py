HeteroCL Tutorial : K-Nearest-Neighbor Digit Recognition
========================================================

**Author**: Yi-Hsiang Lai (yl2666@cornell.edu)

HeteroCL is a domain-specific language (DSL) based on TVM that supports heterogeous
backend devices. Moreover, HeteroCL also supports imperative programming and bit-accurate
data types. This tutorials demonstrates how to write a HeteroCL program using KNN-based
digit recognition.

Digit recognition is wildly used in many fields, such as automotives. Despite the fact
that most digit recognition algorithms rely on deep learning, here we simply use the
KNN-based algorithm. The input is a 7x7 black and white image, which are encoded to 1
and 0, respectively. After we have the input test image, we perform bitwise XOR with
all training images. We then calculate the number of ones for each XOR result. To make
the above process easier, we flatten each 7x7 image to a 49-bit integer, which makes
the bitwise XOR faster. We called the results of number of ones "distance". Our goal
is to find the digit with the smallest distance. In this tutorial, we set K to 3. Namely,
for each digit we will have three candidates. After that, we perform voting according to
the candidates. The winner will be the final label we predict.

To sum up, we can use the following data flow graph to illustrate the whole process.

    +----------------------+      +----------------------------------------------------+
    | 49-bit testing image |  xor | 49-bit training images (10 classes, each has 1800) |
    +----------------------+      +----------------------------------------------------+
                               |
                               V
              +--------------------------------+
              | 49-bit diff shape = (10, 1800) |
              +--------------------------------+
                               |  popcount
                               V
               +-----------------------------+  +------------------------------------+
               | distance shape = (10, 1800) |  | candidates knn_mat shape = (10, 3) |
               +-----------------------------+  +------------------------------------+
                               |                                   |
                               +-----------------------------------+
                                                 | update knn_mat
                                                 V
                                +--------------------------------+
                                | updated knn_mat shape = (10,3) |
                                +--------------------------------+
                                                 | vote
                                                 V
                                          +--------------+
                                          | label (0~10) |
                                          +--------------+

In this tutorial, we assume that we want to offload every operation before voting to FPGA.
Thus, we create a top function for that.

  # Main algorithm
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Following is the main algorithm in the top function

  # Inputs definition
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # To specify an input variable, we use "hcl.var". We can specify the name and data type
  # of the variable. Here the variable is the test image we want to classify. The data type
  # is "uint49". On the other hand, since we have only 49 bits, the maximum difference is
  # 49. Thus, "uint6" is enough.
  test_image = hcl.var()

  # To specify an input tenosr, we use "hcl.placeholder", which is similar to TVM's API.
  # The first field is the shape of the tensor. It is optional for users to set the name
  # and data type. Here the data type is "uint49".
  train_images = hcl.placeholder(data_size)

  # First step: XOR
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # This is the first step of our algorithm. Namely, compute the XOR of a test image with a
  # set of training images. In other words,
  #
  # diff[x][y] = train_images[x][y] ^ test_image, for all x and y in shape (10, 1800)
  #
  # We can use "hcl.compute" to achieve the above computation. This API is declarative.
  # Namely, we only specify the results we want, without explicitly writing how the results
  # should be computed. The first field is the shape; the second field is the input tensors;
  # the third field is a lambda function that computes the results. Without applying any
  # scheduling function, the code is equivalent to
  #
  # for x in range(0, 10):
  #   for y in range(0, 1800):
  #     diff[x][y] = train_images[x][y] ^ test_image
  #
  # Similarly, it is optional for users to specify the name and output data type. This is
  # one of the features of HeteroCL: being able to specify the output data type
  diff = hcl.compute(train_images.shape, [train_images],
      lambda x, y: train_images[x][y] ^ test_image)

  # Second step: popcount
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Our next step is to calculate the number of ones for each value in diff. This is where
  # we call the imperative function "popcount". Since what we want to do here is similar to
  # the XOR operation above, we can again use "hcl.compute". However, we need to let
  # HeteroCL knows the popcount function by using the field "extern". Notice that the
  # output data type here is no longer "uint49".
  dist = hcl.compute(diff.shape, [diff], lambda x, y: popcount(diff[x][y]))

  # Third step: Initialize knn_mat
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The next step is to compute the candidates. In our algorithm, we find the maximum
  # candidate and replace it if the new incoming value is smaller. Thus, we initialize the
  # value of the candidate tensor with 50, which is larger than the maximum possbile
  # distance: 49. To initialize a tensor we can use still use "hcl.compute" API. Since we
  # do not use any tensor in our compute function, the second field is simply an empty list.
  knn_mat = hcl.compute((10, 3), [], lambda x, y: 50)

  # Fourth step: Update knn_mat
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Finally, we update our candidate. Here we can no longer use "hcl.comptue" because we do
  # not update the candidates one by one sequentially. Thus, we use another API called
  # "mut_compute", which compute the lambda function for a given mutation domain. Here we
  # abuse the Python lambda function for simplicity. In Python, a lambda function must
  # return an expression. However, here we return a statement. The code is equivalent to
  # the following Python code
  #
  # for x in range(0, 10):
  #   for y in range(0, 1800):
  #     update_knn(dist, knn_mat, x, y)
  #
  # The interface is almost the same as "hcl.compute". The only differences are: 1. the
  # shape is the mutation domain instead of the output shape, and 2. since we do not return
  # any new output function, there is no field for the data type.
  knn_update = hcl.mut_compute(dist.shape, [dist, knn_mat],
      lambda x, y: update_knn(dist, knn_mat, x, y))

  hcl.resize([test_image, train_images, diff], dtype_image)
  hcl.resize([dist, knn_mat], dtype_knnmat)

  # Final step: build offload function
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # All the above describes the algorithm part. Since this tutorial does not focus on
  # scheduling, we leave the explanation to other tutorials.
  s = hcl.create_schedule(knn_update)

  # At the end, we build the whole offloaded function. Here we reuse TVM's interface, where
  # the first field is the schedule and the second field is a list of all inputs and outputs

  return hcl.build(s, [test_image, train_images, knn_mat])
